The current model uses linear regression of temperature vs sales data within a given department.
This isn't ideal as it accounts for seasonality.  For example Christmas could impact sales for monthes.  These
kinds of long term trends can be difficult to distinguish from long term weather effects.  To account for this,
we need to look at the sales data vs the temperature relative to other temporally local data.  In other words, we need 
to compare the temperature of a week to the temperature of the neighboring weeks or the same weeks in other years.

One way to do this, is to fit a sin/cos curve to our time vs temperature data for each store.  This can be 
accomplished by least squares optimization where we are optimizing the distance our data is from the curve.

Once the curve is fitted, we can interperet the curve as the predicted temperature at each given week and then
calculate the distance of each point from the curve.  If the point is above the curve, it is hotter than we would expect
it to be.  If it is below the curve, it is cooler than we would expect for that week.  We can take these values of 
hotter/colder than expected and compare that to the sales in each department in those corresponding departments.
For example, given that a given week was hotter than expected for
